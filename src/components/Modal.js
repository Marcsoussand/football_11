//Appears when a team has less available forwards than required in the formation.
//To precise the issue, in modern football it is really simple to know who is a goalkeeper, defender and defensive midfielders.
// But for forwards, offensive midfielders and wingers, it is sometime complicated to distinguish them. 
//FPL has always kept a clear rule about it, only strikers are considered as forward, 
//so it explains why there is a lack of forwards and may create such issue.
